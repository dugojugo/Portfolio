## Overview

**Fox vs Catfish Monsters** is an imaginative AR experience where users guide a fox character through a dynamically mapped environment filled with lurking catfish monsters. Built with **Unity3D**, **AR Foundation**, and **Google ARCore**, the project showcases an engaging blend of storytelling, spatial computing, and real-time interaction. This application demonstrates how augmented reality can turn everyday surroundings into playful, interactive scenes, sparking creativity and immersive fun.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic AR Interactions**: Users experience real-time detection and interaction as the fox navigates and responds to the presence of catfish monsters in the AR space.
- **Stunning Visual Integration**: Combines 3D animation and real-world surfaces to create immersive and visually rich storytelling experiences.
- **Unity3D with ARCore**: Harnessed Unity’s AR Foundation with Google’s ARCore SDK to build a responsive and stable AR system that anchors objects accurately in the physical world.
- **Creative Storytelling Through AR**: The playful narrative of fox vs. catfish monsters adds depth, entertainment, and a spark of curiosity to the AR experience, encouraging exploration.
- **Platform Scalability**: Designed for Android devices supporting ARCore, with potential for multi-platform adaptation using Unity’s cross-platform capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity3D Engine & C#**: Core development for scene logic, object animations, and spatial interaction.
- **AR Foundation**: Enabled cross-platform AR development with native AR features.
- **Google ARCore**: For environment mapping, surface detection, and motion tracking to ensure immersive spatial interaction.

## Challenges and Learnings

The challenge was maintaining **scene stability and interactivity** across diverse environments with different lighting and surface textures. Fine-tuning character behavior and animation sync required multiple iterations. The experience deepened understanding of **real-world spatial anchoring, object occlusion, and AR-based UI/UX design**.

## Outcome

This project serves as a vibrant example of how AR can turn fantasy into reality through interactive storytelling. It demonstrates technical mastery of AR development and opens doors for future projects in **education, entertainment, and location-based gaming**.
