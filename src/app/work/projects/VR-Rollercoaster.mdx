## Overview

I was responsible for the creation of immersive experiences designed for the Meta Quest 2 platform. One of the standout projects during my tenure involved engineering a Virtual Reality rollercoaster experience, meticulously tailored for local arcades. Leveraging a Websocket connection for control and harnessing the capabilities of the Kinect V2 Sensor for interactive features like jumping, I showcased my proficiency in crafting bespoke Bezier paths and implementing innovative solutions for dynamic collider scaling based on body image location. This project epitomizes my dedication to pushing the boundaries of VR entertainment while demonstrating my expertise in geometry and problem-solving.

## Key Features

- **Meta Quest 2 VR Integration**: Created a full-body immersive experience with custom Bezier curves to simulate a realistic rollercoaster trajectory.
- **Websocket-Controlled Systems**: Enabled real-time control and reset logic via Websocket protocol, supporting arcade operator interactivity.
- **Kinect V2 Sensor Interaction**: Integrated body-tracked motion using Kinect V2 for jump detection and active participation.
- **Jump Scaling UI**: Implemented a flexible UI slider to let users personalize the sensitivity of the jump mechanic.
- **Dynamic Collider Scaling**: Developed geometry-aware collision zones that adapt in real time based on player position and camera framing, enhancing precision and safety.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity3D Engine & C#**: Built the VR simulation logic, Bezier path systems, and game loop interactions.
- **Websocket Protocol**: For seamless communication between VR client and external arcade control systems.
- **Kinect V2 Sensor**: For full-body tracking and interaction using physical movement.
- **Custom Geometry & Math**: Applied real-time geometry calculations to scale colliders based on screen-space body location.

## Challenges and Learnings

The most complex challenge was **designing responsive collider systems** that accounted for player position in VR space with minimal latency. Ensuring the Kinect jump logic translated smoothly in the rollercoaster context required rigorous testing and calibration. Additionally, working with **real-time Websockets** for operator-level control introduced new layers of architecture and state management, sharpening my skills in **event-driven VR systems**.

## Outcome

This project became a highlight demo for local arcade venues â€” showcasing the fusion of **gesture-based interaction**, **immersive locomotion**, and **hardware-software synchronization**. It solidified my expertise in building full-body interactive VR systems, advancing the potential of entertainment-based XR applications.
