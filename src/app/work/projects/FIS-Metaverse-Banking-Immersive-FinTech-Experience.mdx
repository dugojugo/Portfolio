## Overview

This project involved developing a cutting-edge **Metaverse banking proof-of-concept** by combining real-time APIs, NLP-powered NPCs, and immersive 3D environments. Using FIS CodeConnect APIs and the Unity3D engine, I crafted a virtual banking ecosystem where users could interact, transact, and explore a futuristic financial platform.

## Key Features

- **Unity3D Engine Integration**: Designed and developed an interactive 3D Metaverse environment using Unity, embedding real-world banking capabilities through seamless API integration.
- **Real-Time Voice Communication**: Integrated the **Agora SDK** for voice and communication features, enabling real-time collaboration and social interaction in the virtual bank.
- **FIS CodeConnect APIs**: Enabled secure transactions and account management in the virtual world, simulating real banking workflows in a gamified environment.
- **NLP-driven NPCs with Wit.ai**: Deployed **Wit.ai** for building conversational AI that allows users to interact with NPCs for information, guidance, and customer service – making the experience natural and engaging.
- **Immersive UI Design**: Crafted an intuitive user interface using Unity UI and Blender for smooth navigation through the Metaverse space, ensuring accessibility to various banking features.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity3D Engine & C#**: For immersive Metaverse scene development and logic control.
- **Python**: For backend scripting, NLP prototyping, and JSON handling.
- **FIS CodeConnect API**: For integrating real-world banking services.
- **Wit.ai**: For voice and text-based natural language processing with virtual characters.
- **Agora SDK**: For implementing real-time communication features.
- **Blender 3D**: For modeling and rendering environment assets and UI elements.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing secure financial interactions in a virtual environment posed both **technical and user experience challenges**. Ensuring that API transactions remained context-aware while maintaining real-time performance required strategic design of async workflows and optimized JSON parsing. Developing NLP for multiple banking intents and conversational depth was also a key learning, balancing between simplicity and realism.

## Outcome

The project served as a strong proof-of-concept for **next-generation digital banking**, showcasing how immersive technologies can reshape traditional services. It sparked discussions on the **future of financial UX**, blending AI, real-time communication, and spatial computing into one cohesive experience. The result was a more **engaging, accessible, and futuristic banking interface** – bridging fintech innovation and virtual reality.
