## Overview

**Maze Scrapper** is a mobile puzzle-adventure game created for the **Meta Horizon Creator Competition**, focused on delivering a *first-person maze experience* without a map. Unlike traditional top-down maze games, this title emphasizes memory, instinct, and spatial exploration, encouraging players to collect scattered objects and return to a hub within a procedurally generated environment.

Built with **TypeScript**, **Meta Horizon Worlds desktop editor**, and enhanced by **LLaMA-powered AI tools**, the game reimagines maze navigation through immersive and mobile-first design.

## Key Features

- **Procedural Maze Generation**: Implemented a custom **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm to generate solvable mazes with varied layouts on every playthrough.
- **First-Person Navigation**: Players explore the maze with a limited field of view, enhancing tension and encouraging memorization and orientation.
- **Collect & Return Loop**: Core gameplay revolves around discovering scattered objects and returning them to a central hub.
- **Mobile Swipe Controls**: Designed intuitive touch/swipe navigation with clean UI feedback for a seamless mobile experience.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Used **LLaMA** and other AI tools to accelerate logic scripting, debug interaction flows, and streamline iteration.
- **Meta Horizon 3D Tools**: Utilized 3D modeling and world-building in Meta Horizon’s editor for dynamic environment creation.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript** – Game scripting and interaction logic
- **Meta Horizon Worlds Editor** – 3D environment design and mobile optimization
- **DFS Algorithm** – Graph-based maze layout logic
- **LLaMA AI Tools** – Code generation, bug analysis, and logic refinement
- **YouTube & Devpost** – Demo delivery and submission platform

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing *Maze Scrapper* introduced unique challenges in balancing **randomness and playability**, especially ensuring that each maze is both solvable and challenging. We also faced technical constraints such as prefab bugs and UI limitations within Horizon's editor, which were resolved through iterative debugging and version control.

Creating responsive swipe controls for small screens and synchronizing in-game sounds with procedural events further enhanced the immersive experience.

## Outcome

*Maze Scrapper* delivers a fun, re-playable, and mobile-first puzzle experience that immerses players in a uniquely blind navigation style. The project has been well-received and showcases the potential of **procedural AI-enhanced game development** within the **Meta Horizon Worlds** platform.

It continues to evolve with plans for leaderboard integration, multiplayer modes, and visually themed mazes.
