## Overview

This project introduces a novel VR training system for industrial machine operation, integrating **Reinforcement Learning - Belief Desire Intention (RL-BDI)** agents to assist human users in making better decisions during training. Built using Unity 3D and ML-Agents, the system simulates realistic industrial environments with safety-critical interactions. The **Gradual Training** approach was proposed to speed up agent learning by starting in simple environments and progressively introducing complexity.

## Key Features

- **RL-BDI Agents in Unity**: Trained intelligent agents using Unity ML-Agents and Belief-Desire-Intention architecture to assist and guide trainees through operational procedures.
- **Immersive VR Training**: Leveraged Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit to simulate industrial machine handling in a safe, interactive virtual setting using Head Mounted Displays (HMDs).
- **Gradual Training Methodology**: Designed a curriculum-based learning flow for agents, beginning with basic scenarios and introducing complexity over time to improve agent accuracy and task success rates.
- **Decision-Making Support**: Enabled AI-driven assistance during training sessions, allowing trainees to receive real-time feedback and decision prompts from embedded agents.
- **Productivity and Safety Optimization**: Focused on realistic task modeling and hazard awareness to enhance workforce safety, reduce onboarding costs, and improve procedural adherence.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity3D Engine & C#**: For real-time VR interaction, agent integration, and simulation logic.
- **Unity ML-Agents Toolkit**: For training reinforcement learning agents with PPO and integrating BDI behavior models.
- **XR Interaction Toolkit**: To enable precise interaction with virtual equipment and tools in an immersive VR setting.
- **AI & Serious Gaming**: Combined educational gaming techniques with industrial process simulations for skill development and behavioral reinforcement.
- **HMD (Head Mounted Displays)**: Used VR headsets for immersive deployment and testing.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a dual-system that supported both human and agent learning required the coordination of **AI policy training, interaction design, and user experience**. The **Gradual Training** method significantly enhanced learning efficiency, but designing agent reward functions and scenario transitions demanded careful tuning. Integrating RL-BDI added a layer of behavioral logic, making agent decisions more interpretable and human-like.

## Outcome

This project demonstrated the effectiveness of combining **immersive VR training with AI-driven guidance systems**.
