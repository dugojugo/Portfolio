## Overview

**AgileTutor** is a simulation-based education tool that allows learners to practice **Scrum workflows** in a dynamic, configurable environment. Designed for teaching Agile software development principles, it enables users to simulate full sprint cycles with realistic events, decisions, and ceremonies. From sprint planning to retrospectives and burndown tracking, AgileTutor helps users understand team dynamics and iterative delivery through direct experience.

## Key Features

- **JavaFX UI & Simulation Engine**: Developed an intuitive interface using JavaFX and implemented Scrum logic using Java, ensuring fluid user interactions and accurate workflow modeling.
- **Scrum Framework Coverage**: Simulates key Scrum ceremonies — including sprint planning, reviews, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives — as well as backlog prioritization, story point estimation, and burndown chart generation.
- **Configurable Sprint Cycles**: Supports various team sizes, sprint durations, and random event injections, allowing for varied and repeatable learning scenarios.
- **Realistic Impediment Tracking**: Introduces challenges like blocker events and velocity shifts to encourage decision-making and collaboration.
- **Educational Use Cases**: Designed based on researched Agile practices to reflect real-world team scenarios, making it a valuable **teaching and training tool**.

## Technologies Used

- **Java & JavaFX**: For application logic and interactive GUI components.
- **GitHub Version Control**: Managed collaborative development and release workflows using Git.
- **Agile Simulation Design**: Modeled real-world Agile environments and behaviors for team-based learning.
- **Workflow & Authentication Logic**: Incorporated basic user flow and session persistence features.

## Challenges and Learnings

Simulating realistic Scrum ceremonies in a compact tool required designing **event-driven systems** and tracking user choices across timelines. Creating an intuitive UX for Agile processes also taught us the importance of **educational scaffolding** — gradually introducing complexity while reinforcing learning outcomes. The addition of random events helped simulate unpredictability faced by real development teams, improving realism and learner engagement.

## Outcome

AgileTutor successfully provides **hands-on experience with Agile software development**, allowing users to make decisions, observe outcomes, and understand iterative delivery principles. The tool is ideal for classrooms and workshops focused on **Agile methodology**, bridging the gap between theory and practice with an engaging simulation approach.
