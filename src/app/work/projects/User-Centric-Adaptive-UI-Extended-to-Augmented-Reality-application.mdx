## Overview

This project focused on building a **personalized, adaptive user interface system** that extends from web platforms to **augmented reality (AR)** applications. By tracking **user interactions such as clicks, taps, and navigation patterns**, the system identifies behavioral trends and usage preferences to dynamically tailor the interface. The outcome is a more intuitive, engaging, and accessible experience for users across platforms.

## Key Features

- **ML Model Development & Optimization**: Developed and tested ML models using TensorFlow, Pandas, k-means clustering, and linear regression to optimize user interactions.
- **Vector Database Integration**: Leveraged vector databases to analyze UI markings and enhance interaction-driven insights.
- **High Clustering Accuracy**: Achieved **94.6% clustering accuracy**, improving webpage prioritization and enabling dynamic user experience optimization.
- **Trend Identification**: Mapped navigation flows and time-on-page metrics to determine high-engagement zones and optimize content delivery.
- **Web-to-AR Personalization**: Laid the groundwork for extending adaptive UI patterns from traditional web applications into AR contexts, ensuring consistency and personalization.
- **User Journey Analysis**: Used clustering to simulate typical user journeys, identifying common drop-off points and content engagement strengths.
- **Accessibility Optimization**: Aimed to improve accessibility by adapting interface complexity and layout based on real user needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core scripting for data collection, transformation, and ML modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Implemented **K-means clustering** for user segmentation and interaction analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for rich data visualizations of interaction heatmaps and usage trends.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied basic statistical techniques to derive actionable insights from raw interaction logs.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge involved **balancing model interpretability with clustering accuracy** when segmenting users. Another learning point was designing **cross-platform UI adaptation logic**, ensuring that AR interfaces could meaningfully reflect web usage patterns without introducing cognitive friction. This emphasized the importance of **data-driven design** when creating seamless multi-platform user experiences.

## Outcome

This project proved that **behavior-driven UI adaptation** can significantly enhance user engagement and usability across both web and AR platforms. It offered a **scalable framework for personalization**, paving the way for dynamic interfaces in future AR apps, and driving accessibility by responding to individual interaction styles.
