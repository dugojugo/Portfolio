title: Adaptive Traffic Management System
summary: Developed an adaptive traffic light control system using reinforcement learning, achieving significant reduction in average waiting times and fuel consumption at intersections.
overview: |
  This project focuses on developing an intelligent traffic light control system to optimize traffic flow at intersections. Traditional fixed-time traffic lights often lead to inefficiencies and congestion, especially during peak hours or unexpected traffic events. By employing reinforcement learning, the system can dynamically adjust traffic light timings based on real-time traffic conditions, such as vehicle queues and arrival rates. The goal is to minimize average vehicle waiting times and reduce fuel consumption and emissions.
key_features:
  - Designed and implemented a multi-agent reinforcement learning model for traffic signal control.
  - Utilized SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) as the traffic simulator to train and evaluate the reinforcement learning agent.
  - Developed a custom reward function that considers both minimizing waiting times and promoting smooth traffic flow.
  - Integrated the reinforcement learning agent with the SUMO simulation environment using the TraCI (Traffic Control Interface) API.
  - Conducted extensive simulations under various traffic scenarios to evaluate the performance of the adaptive system against fixed-time control.
  - Demonstrated a significant reduction in average vehicle waiting times and fuel consumption compared to traditional methods.
